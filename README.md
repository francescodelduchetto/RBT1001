# RBT1001
Introduction to Robotics 

## Syllabus

### Week 1:
#### Robotic manipulator, robot components and frame of references.
Intro robotic simulation with Gazebo/Rviz, identify manipulator links, joints and components.

### Week 2:
#### Position and orientation of rigid bodies
Compute rotations, composition of rotations and homogeneous transformations. 
Test the transformations in simulation to move the robot's frames.

### Week 3:
#### Forward and inverse kinematics
Forward kinematics: compute the position of the end effector given join positions (geometric approach and using DH). Test with simulator.
Invers kinematics:
